# 📝 IT Verse - Flutter Learning Notebook

Welcome to **IT Verse**, a digital notebook where I document my Flutter learning journey.  
This repo is a growing log of **widgets**, **animations**, and **packages** I’ve explored while building UI and logic in Flutter.

---

## 🎨 Flutter Widgets (Design)

These are core UI widgets I’ve worked with:

- **Text, Column, Row, Center, SizedBox, Scaffold, AppBar**  
  → Fundamental layout and text components used for basic app structure and display.

- **ListView, GridView**  
  → Used to display scrollable lists and grids of content.

- **ListView.builder, GridView.builder**  
  → Efficient rendering of dynamic or large item lists from data sources.

- **ElevatedButton, IconButton, FloatingActionButton**  
  → Buttons to trigger actions with style and animation options.

## 🎞️ Flutter Animations

I'm exploring how animation enhances user experience:

- **`SingleTickerProviderStateMixin` & `TickerProviderStateMixin`**  
  → Required to manage animation controllers with one or multiple `Ticker`s.

- **Animation Essentials**  
  → Using `AnimationController`, `Tween`, and `Animation` to drive effects.

- **Animation Types**  
  → Applied to widgets: `Fade`, `Scale`, `Slide`, `Rotation`, etc.

- **Animated Widgets**  
  - `AnimatedContainer`, `AnimatedPositioned`, `AnimatedOpacity`, etc.  
    → Implicit animations: easy to use with built-in smooth transitions.
  - `AnimatedSwitcher`  
    → Used to animate between widgets when content changes.

- **AnimationBuilder & Listeners**  
  → For custom control over animation lifecycle and complex effects.
→ And Much More.

- ✅ Multiple animations can be applied to a **single widget** for compound motion.
→ Much More.

## 📦 Packages I've Explored

- **[introduction_screen](https://pub.dev/packages/introduction_screen)**  
  → For onboarding pages. Requires integration with `dots_indicator` for pagination.

- **[flutter_animate](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_animate)**  
  → Easy, declarative animations without complex setup.

- **[fluttertoast](https://pub.dev/packages/fluttertoast)**  
  → Used to display temporary feedback messages (toasts) after actions like saving data.

- **[shared_preferences](https://pub.dev/packages/shared_preferences)**  
  → For storing simple persistent data like login state or input text locally.
→ Much More.

## ✍️ Learning Philosophy

> This repo is a **hands-on Flutter learning log** — not a final app.  
I experiment, break, fix, and document everything here to improve daily.

Feel free to explore, learn, and fork this notebook if it helps your own Flutter journey!
